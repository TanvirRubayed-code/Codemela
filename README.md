<h1>Best recipe</h1>
<h2>Kachichi Biryani</h2>
<p>One of the most popular recipe in Bangladesh </p>
<p>Being welcoming and extremely hospitable is a hallmark of Bangladeshi culture.  Visitors and friends are always
 welcome to drop in, sometimes even unannounced.  Open doors, sheer hospitality, and friendly disposition are an integral
 part of the society.  Add tons of mouthwatering food shared by the guests and host with chic-chat, laughter, love, and 
you have a complete picture of sociable Bangladeshis.
Naturally, I am very passionate about highlighting Bangladeshi cooking.  When I started to think about my guest post
 on Chef Dennisâ€™s blog, Kachchi biryani appeared to be the perfect dish to share with all of you, as I would have prepared
 if I were to welcome each of you in a large group to my home over dinner.  Kachchi biryani is usually a featured dish for
 weddings and social gatherings and celebrations.  Layers of meat, rice and potatoes are infused with warm and delectable
 blends of aromatic spices to prepare kachchi biryani.  Whether it is a tender piece of mutton, potato, alubokhara(prune)
 or the rice itself, each spoonful is a mouthwatering surprise.  I find this grand biryani to have lesser prep time because
 all the ingredients are put in layers and then in the oven instead of cooking the rice and meat 
separately and then combining (leaving me with less pots to clean afterwards also).</p>

<li>We have to mixed all the components with oil,solt,and other necessary component.&#x1F607</li>
<li>Then we should boil for 20 minutes.&#x1F60D</li>
<li>After that we have to check that.&#x1F929</li>
<li>And at last we should fry it till it has been done.&#x1F60B</li>

<p>First time, I kept the biryani in the oven for 3.5 hours worrying about undercooked meat.  Now I turn off the oven 
after 1.5 hours.  Also, in my never ending quest to find an easier way, my spin to the recipe is to skip the sealing 
process with dough and instead just use a lid that perfectly fits the cooking pot; saves time and no sticky fingers.Cooking kachchi 
biryani is a labor of love and each time it is perfectly paid off when family and friends gather around the table to 
bond, enjoy and laugh together while savoring delicious, mouthwatering Biryani.   It is a perfect celebration food for 
small family get-together as well as large gatherings.

 

A simple salad or a colorful one is sufficient as a side for kachchi biryani but traditionally; shami kabab and chutney are served alongside.  To complete the meal, add traditional Bangladeshi chal kumrar morobba, pranhara or pumpkin halva as dessert.
lot less messy kitchen.  The result is still a flavorful, divine kachchi biryani.</p>
